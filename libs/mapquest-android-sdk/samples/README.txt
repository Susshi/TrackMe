Hi there! Thanks for downloading the MapQuest SDK for Android, we're glad you did. We've put a lot of time into making this SDK easy to use and easy to transition if you were using another mapping SDK. We think you'll like it.

Downloading the Android SDK
===========================
First things first, if you are new to Android, you should probably follow this Android SDK tutorial to get your environment set up:
http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
It covers installing Eclipse, installing the Android SDK, installing the ADT (Android Developer Toolkit) plugin for Eclipse, as well as some other helpful information.

Setting Up and Running a Sample Project In Eclipse
==================================================
Okay, now that that's out of the way, we can get you started by setting up a project in Eclipse to run the Sample Apps we have included in this download. We have included numerous sample activities that showcase some of the core components of the MapQuest Android SDK, ranging from simple overlays to getting and displaying routes. To run these samples, you will have to create a sample project by following the steps below.

Before we get started though, these steps assume that:
- You have installed and are familiar with Eclipse environment, if not please visit www.eclipse.org.
- You have installed and are familiar with Android SDK and ADT eclipse plugin, if not please visit http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

1) Import the Sample App
		Open a new Eclipse workspace, then select File > Import, General, Existing Projects into Workspace. Select the samples directory within the directory you downloaded the sdk to (e.g. ~/Desktop/mapquest-android-sdk/samples), then click "Open". Ensure the project named "samples" is checked, and click "Finish". (You might also make sure this project is using the global project settings, you can do this by right-clicking on the 'samples' project in the Package Explorer and select Properties, then "Java Compiler" and ensure the "Enable project specific settings" is unchecked)
	
2) Run the SampleLauncher App!
	You are all ready to run the demo activities, all of which can be launched from the SampleLauncher app. To run the app, right-click on 'samples' in the Package Explorer, select Run As > Android Application. If you have an Android phone device into your computer or an AVD manager set up, it will launch the app where you can choose to view any number of sample activities showcasing the features of the SDK.
